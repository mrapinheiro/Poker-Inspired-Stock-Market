# Poker-Inspired Stock Trading Strategy

## Introduction
This project explores the application of poker-inspired strategies to navigate the stock market, focusing particularly on the historical price data of Apple Inc. (AAPL). By treating investment decisions similarly to poker bets—where success hinges on probabilistic thinking and strategic risk management—we attempt to draw parallels between these seemingly disparate activities.

## Project Overview
The core idea of this project is to apply decision trees and probabilistic thinking—key strategies in poker—to trading strategies in the stock market. We explore the effectiveness of such strategies by analyzing AAPL stock price fluctuations, converting them into binary outcomes, and creating decision sequences that guide trading actions.

## Strategy Overview
The strategy involves analyzing monthly AAPL stock returns and making trading decisions based on the probability patterns identified from historical data. We summarize the outcomes as binary events and examine the sequence of these events to forecast future price movements.

## Results
Our findings indicate that while the poker-inspired trading strategy offers interesting insights and a novel approach to stock market trading, it underperforms compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy over the long term. However, the methodology emphasizes the importance of strategy, risk management, and adaptive learning in trading.

## Conclusion
This investigation demonstrates the potential of interdisciplinary approaches to stock trading, though it also highlights the challenges and complexities inherent in the stock market that differ significantly from controlled games like poker.
